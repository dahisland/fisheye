# Project Fisheye

FishEye is a website that allows freelance photographers to showcase their best work. They recently raised funds and would like to update their website.

# Technologies :

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript

# Accessibility :

This project consists of implementing the entire application in javascript by using the models provided.

Accessibility is paramount in this project. User must be able to navigate in the entire website by using his keyboard keys and screen readers must have access to the content of each element.

For that, attributes aria, role, tabindex have been cleverly implemented, also like focus management.
Also, subtitles have been added for the videos.

The code uses factories patterns to make it maintainable, robust and easier to interpret.

# Tests :

For the tests, the screen reader NVDA and Chrome Screen Reader have been used.
